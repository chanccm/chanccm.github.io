My husband and I have done snorkeling at Izu Peninsula, Okinawa main Island, and Ishigaki before. So far the very best is at Miyakojima, which is between Ishigaki and Okinawa main Island. Miyakojima and Ishigaki are comparable in size, and are both very close to Taiwan. Ishigaki is more well-developed, and well-known among foreign tourists, while in Miyakojima, we simply focused on the beaches and snorkeling.

We spent three days at Shigira beach. On the first day, we snorkeled around and surveyed the area. The beach was so very much alive! Fish, fish, fish of all sizes and colors, sea cucumber, sea anemone, snails, sea orchins, and of course corals. We saw a sea turtle as well!!

On the second day, we knew what we really want to see - clown fish and sea turtle. We had to wait around a bit for the sea turtle but were not disappointed!

I really like these little fish. They don't turn away, don't hide when they perceive a threat to themselves and their home - the sea anemone. They come up and try to stare you down.

Sea turtles seen on the second and third days. I think they are different individuals.

And the only time we were in any real danger was with these Titan Triggerfish. There were sea snakes and moray eels, but they hide from people. Titan Triggerfish on the other hand, will chase you down and bite if you wander into their territory.

That's my husband trying to get between the Triggerfish and his stupid wife who was getting too close to this curious-looking fish to take some cool pictures.

Global warming has affected coral reefs all over the Earth, and Miyakojima is no exception. News reports say that compared to Ishigaki, the effects of global warming and ocean acidification are not as severe, due to these islands being visited by different ocean currents. But still, we saw a lot of dead corals, and it was quite disheartening. If you want to see the beauty of Miyakojima, go now!

As a biologist and data scientist, I should take random sampling of the sealife in the form of photos, feed them into a image recognition algorithm, tally the number of species and number of individuals of each species, and track the changes over time...
