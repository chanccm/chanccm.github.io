Croft is...was one of the best horses at the riding club, until I was partnered up with him I guess.

In addition to horses, I also love dogs. I have always wanted a dog. But when you are living in an apartment in Japan, keeping a dog is a luxury not many people have.

So I trained Croft to give me hugs and kisses for carrots, just as I want my imaginary dog to be -  a loving Golden Retriever. (Not the carrot part, but the give me hugs and kisses part.)

Apparently that can mess up a horse. Now the only command from me he listens to is 'Hug', followed by feeding him carrots. He won't trot, won't canter...

I've got to stop this nonsense. Don't treat a horse as if it's a dog...
